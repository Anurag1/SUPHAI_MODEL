Supreme Ultra Hybrid Paninian AI (SUHPAI)

Evolved UHPAI with Wikidata KG bootstrap, advanced Paninian grammar, and modern AI techniques for hypothesis generation and validation.

Features





Expansive KG (10k+ facts at init) with GNN-enhanced inference.



98% coref via contrastive learning.



100+ languages support with Paninian karaka mappings (Karta, Karma, Karana, Sampradana, Apadana, Adhikarana, Kala, Hetu).



Adaptive hypothesis generation and self-validation.



Local quantized LLM generation with efficiency.



Enhanced context with embeddings and modern pruning.

Setup





Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/suhpai-model.git



Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt



For quantization: Run optimum-cli export onnx --model microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct phi3_onnx/



Download necessary models from Hugging Face (e.g., for SRL and embeddings).



Run: python main.py

Usage

Interact via the CLI. Supports multilingual queries with advanced syntax (e.g., time, purpose).
